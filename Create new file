I am going to create a new file in github and see if it finally appears on my local machine.
Local edits to files which were cloned from GitHub repository. I hope it works. 
"Git push" has worked for me and I am super excited about it. I now want to try the git push command. See you from the other side.
We met here again, what a wonderful day!!
Git clone, git push, and git pull are truly working.
